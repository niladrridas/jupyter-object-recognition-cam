# Jupyter Object Recognition Cam

## Overview

This project captures video frames from the webcam and performs object recognition on each frame using a pre-trained model (example: MobileNet SSD). Detected objects are displayed with bounding boxes and labels.

## Features

- Object detection using a pre-trained model.
- Adjustable confidence threshold.
- Real-time webcam feed visualization.
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook for testing and development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `notebooks/Object_Recognition_Cam.ipynb`.
2. Adjust the paths to the pre-trained model files in the notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells to initiate the webcam feed and object recognition.
4. Optionally, customize the parameters and code for your specific use case.

### Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for testing and development.
- `src/`: Includes modularized code for object recognition.
- `data/`: Optional directory for storing pre-trained model weights or sample data.
